# ASIC Theory
ASIC stands for Application-Specific Integrated Circuit. It is a type of integrated circuit (IC) that is specially designed for a particular application or use case rather than being a general-purpose chip. ASICs are optimized for specific tasks, and their design is tailored to perform those tasks efficiently and with high performance.

The Github repository documents and tracks the progress for the course Physical Design ASIC(VL508).

<summary><strong>Open Source simulator iverilog</strong></summary>

Simulator is a tool to verify that the said design adheres to the functionality to its intended specifications. It works by following the input given and changes the output accordingly, thus one can compare the desired output and the output derived for the said inputs.

Simulator architecture schematic diagram -
![Simulator](https://github.com/Shant1R/Shant_IIITB/assets/59409568/11d0647f-499b-4ea9-ab80-8c6ef20da093)

Under the given repository, **Iverilog** is used which is an open source simulator.
- Design is the set of verilog codes with the aim to create a functionality that meets the given specifications. 
- Testbench is the set of code which provides the stimulas or test vectors to the desgin under test to verify the design working.
- It is to be noted multiple inputs can be given the design block and multiple outputs can be derived.
- The testbench is not given any external inputs. Testvectors are given under the testbench itself.
- The output of the simulator is a VCD file, ie. value change dump file which is viewed using **GTKWave** to visualise the waveform.

<summary><strong>Introduction to Lab</strong></summary>

Under this, we will go through how to setup the directory and lab for the course and how to access various files and execute.

**Lab Setup**

The first step under the lab setup for the course is to form a seperate directory as VLSI and git clone the course files from the given repository in the code.



```bash
$ cd Documents
$ cd ASICs
$ cd VLSI
$ cd git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop.git
```

Terminal Window - 
![sky130_gitclone](https://github.com/Shant1R/Shant_IIITB/assets/59409568/8e74128d-3341-4378-9c40-309260327bef)

Upon the cloning, a new folder with the name *sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop* is made. Under this folder, there will be several folders, such as lib which contains the standard set library for sky130 which will be used for the synthesis, verilog_files which contains all the source files and testbenches for the experiments to be done. The contents of each folder can be seen by going into the directory and entering ls.


**Working with iverilog and gtkwave - MUX**

Under this, we go over how load files on iverilog and visualise using gtkwave. The terminal is opened and the directory is set to the verilog_files, where various source files and their respective testbenches are stored. Under this example we will execute the mux using good_mux.v and check the functionality using gtkwave to visualise the dumpfile generated. Both the source file and testbench are loaded to iverilog. 

```bash
$ cd VLSI
$ cd sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop
$ cd verilog_files/
$ ls
$ iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v
$ ./a.out
$ gtkwave tb_good_mux.vcd
```

Screenshot of the terminal -

The waveform on gtkwave is used to check the variations in the output with the input.

**Code Explaination - MUX**

To edit the code, one can directly open the files or use gvim. The code to access both the source and testbech is given

```bash
$ gvim tb_good_mux.v -o good_mux.v
```


Editor window -

There can be multiple ways to generate a mux. Under the given source code. it checks for the select line, if sel is 1, the output follows the input line 1 else it follows input line 0. Under the testbench, the inputs are set as reg and output as wire. The testbench has no primary inputs like the design source code. It instantiate the source code as uut - unit under test, any name can be used. Under the testbench, the dumpfile is generated for visualisation. The input variables are set and the toggled periodically and sets an end time.

<summary><strong>Introduction to Yosys and Logic synthesis</strong></summary>

The RTL design is the behavioural model of the said specification written in an HDL language. For mapping this code to a hardware circuit comes the synthesis. The RTL code is translated to gate level using the front end libraries that are .lib files, through synthesis the netlist file is derived. 

The front end library is also called .lib, which can be explained as a collection for modules for the logic gates for the mapping. It contains various types of the same logic gate, such as 2 and 3 input and gates, and modules for the same gate with different execution speed, which can de decided upon the usecase and required specification. The speed of the gates depends the load, which for digital circuits are capacitors, thus charging and discharging of capacitors determine the speed of the gate, thus the system. For faster speed, we need transistor with more current sourcing capacity. Thus the need for wider transistors. But wider transistors enables faster processes with the trade off of power and area. Narrow transistors comsumes lesser area and power, but comes with bigger delays. Thus the choice of the gate models is made accordingly. The time delat should small enough to cover the propogation delay and setup times and at the same time large enough that it doesn't cause a hold crisis, that is its bigger than the hold time of the next gate in process.


One has to guide the synthesizer for the required execution time, ie, the use of faster and slower transistor models while mapping. This is known as constraints.    

The synthesizer used under this coursework is Yosys. 

Yosys setup flow-
![yosys1](https://github.com/Shant1R/Shant_IIITB/assets/59409568/35698376-e603-40eb-b5a4-a84965620587)

The design block has the function read_design and .lib  has a read_liberty function which reads the design file and .lib respectively. The netlist block has the fucntion read_netlist which upon execution generates the netlist file for the given design. It is to note design file and netlist file are two different representations for the same given specification.  

Synthesis verification flow - 
![yosys2](https://github.com/Shant1R/Shant_IIITB/assets/59409568/8c89fc9e-7d6a-426e-b55f-3927db75d7e7)

To verify the synthesis output, we use the iverilog simulator which is given the netlist and testbench as inputs, attain a vcd file, which is visualised using gtkwave. The output on the gtkwave with the netlist file should be the same as in the case of RTL simulation. Since the primary inputs and outputs in case of RTL designs and netlist design remains the same, the same testbench can be used to verify the design.

<details>
<summary><strong>Lab using Yosys and Sky130 PDKs</strong></summary>

Under this section, we go through how to invoke the synthesizer yosys and synthesize the design. For the demonstration, we have taken the synthesis of mux, the good_mux.v file, which we have previously simulated before. 

- Step one is to go to the directory for the verilog files and invoke yosys synthesizer.

```bash
$ cd Documents/ASICs/VLSI/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files/
$ yosys
```

![yosys_lab_1](https://github.com/Shant1R/Shant_IIITB/assets/59409568/24e98dd7-b81c-4398-a0cb-f5d5bf872813)

- Now we read the .lib using *read_liberty* and the path is set to the .lib files.
- The behavourial model of mux is read using *read_verilog* followed by determining the module name to be synthesized.
- The netlist is generated by *abc -liberty* followed by the path to .lib which specifies what gates are to be linked. Thus the RTL file is converted to netlist.
- The logic being realised can be view using *show*.

```bash
 read_liberty -lib ~/Documents/ASICs/VLSI/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
 read_verilog good_mux.v
 synth -top good_mux
 abc -liberty ~/Documents/ASICs/VLSI/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
 show
```

![yosys_lab_2](https://github.com/Shant1R/Shant_IIITB/assets/59409568/e3861c1c-4493-4fe1-822b-7e5179d95ab0)

- The netlist file is wriiten using *write_verilog* followed by the name for the file.
- Gvim edittor is used view the netlist file.

```bash
 read_verilog good_mux_netlist.v
 !gvim good_mux_netlist.v  
```

![yosys_lab_3](https://github.com/Shant1R/Shant_IIITB/assets/59409568/c201daec-bc2b-44f7-83c5-77ab3dd37e9d)

- It can seen that the netlist file has extra informations, thus to generate a simple netlist file we add an extra switch.
- After *write _verilog* we add *-noattr* before the file name.
- We attain a simpler netlist representation for mux.

```bash
 read_verilog -noattr good_mux_netlist.v
 !gvim good_mux_netlist.v
```

![yosys_lab_4](https://github.com/Shant1R/Shant_IIITB/assets/59409568/a917b533-9932-46bd-adfb-032cea61855b)

## DAY 2 - Timing libs, Hierarchical vs Flat synthesis and effective flop coding styles

<details>

<summary><strong>Introduction to .lib</strong></summary>
Under this section, we get a better insight regarding .lib. We have the general overview that it stores the models of all the standards cells, various variations and flavours as per the need of specification provided. Getting an insight into the .lib file, we start with the file name -  

*sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80*

The name sky130 represemts that the library is based on 130nm technology. Under the nomenclature, we define PVT - process, voltage and temperature. Process refers to the variations due to the fabrication, ie. there will variations in the silicon fabricated even by the same machine. There is variation due to the voltage and temperature as well. Silicon is very sensitive to temperature. All these 3 determines how the silicon is going to perform. We aim to design such that silicon works in all the conditions, across various variations. These three are indicated under the name, tt stands for typical process, 25c indicates the temperature - 25C and 1v80 indicates the voltage of 1.80volts.  It is to be noted, all the models under the said library are designed for the given PVT parameters.

We open the .lib file using gvim to go through various other informations it provides.

![lib_1](https://github.com/Shant1R/Shant_IIITB/assets/59409568/f1a46b64-c496-4fd4-82e7-ef43e091964b)

- It defines the technology begin used "CMOS" and the delay model as "table_lookup"
- it defines the units for various parameters and quanities, such as, 1ns for time, 1V for voltage, 1mA for current, 1kohm for resistance and 1pF for capacitance.
- It defines the operating conditions as "tt_025C_1v80".

We take an example for a cell to understand the contents. Taking the example of a21110i cell. 

![lib_2](https://github.com/Shant1R/Shant_IIITB/assets/59409568/9996a4bc-1328-4436-91f0-551a17dd7d72)

- The given cell executes the logic for 5 inputs, *and* for the first two inputs and *or* it with the next three inputs, finally *not* the final expression.
- Logic implemented --> !((A1&A2)|B1|C1|D1)
- Since we got 5 inputs, there are 32 possible outputs. The .lib file contains the power consumption and timing details for all the possibilities.


Considering a two input *and* gate, and compare different two input and gate.

![lib_3](https://github.com/Shant1R/Shant_IIITB/assets/59409568/717b8741-8d21-413e-95b2-968c38eef551)

- The lib files conatins the power and timing information for the 4 possible outcomes.
- All three taken cells are 2 input and gates, but differ in their areas, and2_4 has a larger area than area2_2 and consequently more than and2_0.
- Having a larger area refers to the use of a wider cell. Wider cells will be faster, but consumes more power. This can be seen in the datials under the lib file.

<summary><strong>Heirarchial vs Flat Synthesis</strong></summary>

Under this section, we go over what is heirchial synthesis and flat synthesis. For this, we  have taken the case of multiple_modul2s.v from verilog files to have a better unstanding.
```bash
  shant@shant:~/Documents/ASICs/VLSI/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files$ gvim multiple_modules.v
```

We go into the directory for verilog files and invole the model.

```bash
$ cd Documents/ASICs/VLSI/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files
$ yosys
read_liberty -lib ~/Documents/ASICs/VLSI/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
read_verilog multiple_modules.v
synth -top multiple_modules
abc -liberty ~/Documents/ASICs/VLSI/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
show multiple_modules
```

- As we hit show, we expect to attain a similar schematic we had drew in the previous image.
  
![hvf_2](https://github.com/Shant1R/Shant_IIITB/assets/59409568/a55d9d7a-ab21-430c-8174-770f422220f5)

- We get the image of the top module.
- We don't get to see the and and or gates. We see the modules u1 and u2, which are the instances of the gates.
- **This type of design is called an heirarchial design.**
- We generate the netlist file for the design.

```bash
write_verilog -noattr multiple_modules_hier.v
!gvim multiple_modules_hier.v
```

![hvf_3](https://github.com/Shant1R/Shant_IIITB/assets/59409568/620892c8-1681-4d46-911e-1e7a2e4a8ee7)

- In the netlist generated, it is observed that the hierarchy is maintained. The top module has instances of sub moduke 1 and 2, and the two modules are seperately defined implementing the *and* and *or* gates.
- It is to be more, since this is CMOS technology, we implement the gates using a *nand* gate with inverted inputs for *or* gate and *nor* gate with inverted inputs for *and* gate.

Now we will look into flat design techcnique.

```bash
flatten
show multiple_modules
```

![hvf_5](https://github.com/Shant1R/Shant_IIITB/assets/59409568/9428f816-7ab6-49f6-a3d4-0c527719364c)

```bash
write_verilog -noattr multiple_modules_flat.v
!gvim multiple_modules_flat.v
```

![hvf_4](https://github.com/Shant1R/Shant_IIITB/assets/59409568/a9476f35-4ba0-4caa-a035-893227557410)

- In the new netlist, we don't see any instances of submodules such as u1 and u2.
- We get direct instances of *and* and *or* gates under the flat design.
- **This type of design is known as flat desigin techniques.**

We saw how to synthesis the top module, now we will look into synthesis of submodules.

```bash
$ cd Documents/ASICs/VLSI/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files
$ yosys
read_liberty -lib ~/Documents/ASICs/VLSI/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
read_verilog multiple_modules.v
synth -top sub_module1
abc -liberty ~/Documents/ASICs/VLSI/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
show
```

![hvf_6](https://github.com/Shant1R/Shant_IIITB/assets/59409568/48519618-7a15-4695-a075-c0ca9acb4853)

- We only see submodule 1, we don't get to see the multiple module or submodule 2.

Reason for having synthesis at submodule level ->
- In case my design has multiple instances of same module, we prefer to synthesis it once and the replicate it as many times required and stitch it to the main module.
- It supports *divide and conqure appraoch*. In case the design is massive, we give small portions to the tool instead of the entire design. This helps in generating an optimised netlist for the complete desgin and supports reusebility.

<summary><strong>Various Flop Coding Styles and Optimizations</strong></summary>

Under this section, we go through all the various types of flops available and how to design and code them efficiently. All the required files are presen in the folder verilog_files. 

To understand the need of flops, we refer the example of a simple circuit with delays as 2ns for *and* gate and 1ns for *or* gate.

![ff_1](https://github.com/Shant1R/Shant_IIITB/assets/59409568/d9bd0c57-605b-4c7b-8724-297ab5b812d6)

- Considering the input goes from 0 to 1 for a and b and simultaneously, 1 to 0 for c.
- Ideally for the transition from (001) to (110), the output should have been a constant at 1, but because of the delay, we get outout as 0 for a brief period of 2ns.
- This is called a **glitch**.

![ff_2](https://github.com/Shant1R/Shant_IIITB/assets/59409568/f75878fe-d695-44cf-b498-f516b7d2a028)
  
- More the number of combinational circuits, more number of glitches appear, giving a glitchy output.
- To avoid this, we need an element to store the value. Comes the flops into picture.
- We use a D flipflop. They are a storage element. They are placed between combinational circuits and changes value only at clock edge.

![ff_1](https://github.com/Shant1R/Shant_IIITB/assets/59409568/eb9ab8c7-a87c-4ca0-89ec-ecb36361032e)

  
- Now even if the the input of the clock is glitching, we attain a stable output.
- **NOTE** --> We need to initailise the flops, else the combinational circuits gives a garbage value. For this purpose we have reset and set pins. They can be asynchoronous and synchronous.

Types of flops
- Flops can be designed to be asynchronous or synchronous. It depends on whether the flop is sensitive to the reset and set parameters.
- Under asynchronous, the flop is sensitive to the reset or set, ie the design checks for them and the moment, reset is encountered, the output is pulled to **0** irrespective of the clock. For asynchronous set, the output is pulled to **1**.
- The circuit design and timing diagram along with verilog code is displayed under the image below under column 1.
- Under the case of synchronous reset, the output is pulled to **0** at the next clock cycle. The design and timing diagram along the verilog code is shown under the column 2 of the image below.
- Sync reset can be understodd as the input is pulled to 0, thus output becomes 0 for next clock cycle.

![ff_2](https://github.com/Shant1R/Shant_IIITB/assets/59409568/77037d1a-28bd-434f-9ed4-ddb57613973c)

- Under column of the image above, shows the verilog code and circuit structure for a d flipflop that accounts for sync as well as async resets.


Now, we go through simuations of async reset, async set and sync async reset and observe the waveforms using gtkwave to have a better understand.

***Code --> dff_asyncres.v***

```bash
module dff_asyncres ( input clk ,  input async_reset , input d , output reg q );
always @ (posedge clk , posedge async_reset)
begin
	if(async_reset)
		q <= 1'b0;
	else	
		q <= d;
end
endmodule
```

- We can observe that the output q goes to 0 when the reset is encountered.
- Now we synthesis the design using yosys.

![dff_syn_1](https://github.com/Shant1R/Shant_IIITB/assets/59409568/67fbc5d1-0016-4c7d-9917-66bddc85bb39)

- We can observe that the output q goes to 1 as soon as we encounter the set irrespective of that clock.
-Now we synthesis the design using yosys.

- It is observed that the output q is set to 0 at the next clock pulse when the reset is encountered, thus it is the case of sync reset.
- Now we synthesis the design using yosys.

![dff_syn_3](https://github.com/Shant1R/Shant_IIITB/assets/59409568/83e54797-cb25-4734-97e9-2269e25b2f39)

- We can observe that output q goes to 0 when encountered the async reset and waits for the next clock edge to set q to 0 in case of encounter with sync reset.
- Now we synthesis the design using yosys.

<summary><strong>Interesting Optimisations</strong></summary>

Under this section we look into two interesting cases and how they are executed and designed.

First we look into mul2.v

- Code for mul2.v

```bash
module mul2 (input [2:0] a, output [3:0] y);
	assign y = a * 2;
endmodule
```

- The block diagram and the truth table for the executed logic is shown under.
   
![sp_1](https://github.com/Shant1R/Shant_IIITB/assets/59409568/774a0cd2-2144-4bce-bab3-b498db7ef417)

- From these, we are able to infer that the logic requires the input to be multiplied with 2, and upon checking the output it is the input with 1'b0 padding.
- Thus the design for the logic needs no hardware to be mapped.
- We will confirm this using yosys.

![sp_2](https://github.com/Shant1R/Shant_IIITB/assets/59409568/ee8c1ac5-23e4-4339-a6d5-9affa8741ffa)

- From the yosys synthesis, we observe the number of cells in design is 0 and there is no hardware to be mapped. These have been highlighted in the picture above.
- The schematic attained shows a similar result.
- This was done in case of multiplication with 2. For multiplication with 4, we give 2'b00 padding and for 8, we give 3'b000 padding. This goes on.

Now, we look into another special case. 
- Condider a 3bit number a[2:0], and the logic to be implemented is that the output y[5:0] is equal to 9 times of a[2:0].
- Code for execution

```bash
module mult8 (input [2:0] a , output [5:0] y);
	assign y = a * 9;
endmodule
```

- Logic explaination

![sp_3](https://github.com/Shant1R/Shant_IIITB/assets/59409568/44bbe634-8835-4d0e-b783-6edd05ce9717)

- Multiplcation with 9 can be seen as multiplication with 8 and plus 1.
- We know multiplication with 8 is equal to 3'b000 padding, and adding the same 3 bit number to the padded number comes of as concatanation of {a,a}.
- Thus there are no standard cell required for the design. We verify this using yosys.

![sp_4](https://github.com/Shant1R/Shant_IIITB/assets/59409568/7da4d7a5-2ea6-4b55-a5d3-95103956e2dd)

- We see that there are no standard cells required.
- We see the concatanation operation done in the netlist.

## DAY 3 - Combinational and Sequential Optimization

<details>

<summary><strong>Introduction to Optimizations</strong></summary>
Under this section, we will look into how to optimise our design for combinational logic as well as sequentail logic designs. The optimised designs are defined in terms of area and power savings.

<br></br>
**Methods for Combinational logic Optimization**
- Direct Method --> *Constant Propogation*
- Boolean logic meth0d --> *K-map or Quine McKluskey*

**Constant Propogation**

Consider the logic circuit under figure(I), if we ground input a, ie, a=0, the entire expression goes from y=(a.b+c)' to y=c'.

![opt_1](https://github.com/Shant1R/Shant_IIITB/assets/59409568/98ab0ccf-8237-4a23-a956-8754e4da080c)

- For implementing figure(I), we require in total of 6 transitors under CMOS technology. Whereas, for the final ciruit under fig(II) with the given constraints, we require only 2 transistors under CMOS tech. Thus we can see that we have reduces the number of transistors, hence better optimised.

**Boolean Logic**

Consider we try to implement a logic using tertiary operator, such as **y = a?(b?c:(c?a:0)):(!c)**. This can be mapped using three 2 input muxs as shown in the figure

![opt_2](https://github.com/Shant1R/Shant_IIITB/assets/59409568/de299ebb-619d-4a39-ab9e-667dd355c99b)

- The output generated using the circuit shown is **y = a'.b' + a.[ b.c + b'.a.c ]**, which is clear that is not optimised. The logic can be optimised using K-maps. The optimised logic comes as **~( a ^ b )**.


The synthesis tool performs these optimisations to come up with an effective and optimised design.


**Methods for Sequential logic Optimization**
- Basic --> Sequential Constant Propogation
- Advanced methods.

**Sequential Constant Propogation**

Under this the flop can be optimised in case the output of the flop is constant, else if the output of flop changes, the entire flop is retained. To understand this we take two examples

- The input of D ff is grounded, ir d=0, and the reset parameter is given. Here even if the reset is given or not the output output of the flop is constant at 0, hence the overall outcome is constant.

![opt_3](https://github.com/Shant1R/Shant_IIITB/assets/59409568/6fd15cfc-6bfe-4c8e-a452-71439110468f)


- Now taking the same circuit, but instead of reset, we give set. Now when the set is 1, the flop output follows set. As soon as set is removed, the output goes to 0 at the next positive clock edge. Thus now we can't remove the flop from design, Thus we retain the flop. 

![opt_4](https://github.com/Shant1R/Shant_IIITB/assets/59409568/5dd4680f-b2dc-4596-9916-f359ec6bcfbd)

**Advanced Methods for Sequential logic Optimisation**

- **State optimization** in ASIC design is about finding the best trade-offs among performance, power efficiency, area utilization, and other design objectives to create an effective and efficient custom integrated circuit for a particular application.
- **Re-timing** is the technique used to optimize the timing performance of a digital circuit by moving registers (flip-flops) to different locations within the circuit without changing its functionality. The primary goal of retiming is to improve the critical path delay, which is the longest path through the logic circuit that determines the maximum operating frequency.
- **Sequential logic cloning** or **flip-flop cloning** or **state machine cloning** is the technique used to replicate or duplicate certain portions of sequential logic circuits. This technique is employed to improve performance, reduce critical path delays, or optimize power consumption in a design without altering its functional behavior.
