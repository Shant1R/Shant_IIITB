# ASIC Theory
ASIC stands for Application-Specific Integrated Circuit. It is a type of integrated circuit (IC) that is specially designed for a particular application or use case rather than being a general-purpose chip. ASICs are optimized for specific tasks, and their design is tailored to perform those tasks efficiently and with high performance.

The Github repository documents and tracks the progress for the course Physical Design ASIC(VL508).

<summary><strong>Open Source simulator iverilog</strong></summary>

Simulator is a tool to verify that the said design adheres to the functionality to its intended specifications. It works by following the input given and changes the output accordingly, thus one can compare the desired output and the output derived for the said inputs.

Simulator architecture schematic diagram -
![Simulator](https://github.com/Shant1R/Shant_IIITB/assets/59409568/11d0647f-499b-4ea9-ab80-8c6ef20da093)

Under the given repository, **Iverilog** is used which is an open source simulator.
- Design is the set of verilog codes with the aim to create a functionality that meets the given specifications. 
- Testbench is the set of code which provides the stimulas or test vectors to the desgin under test to verify the design working.
- It is to be noted multiple inputs can be given the design block and multiple outputs can be derived.
- The testbench is not given any external inputs. Testvectors are given under the testbench itself.
- The output of the simulator is a VCD file, ie. value change dump file which is viewed using **GTKWave** to visualise the waveform.

<summary><strong>Introduction to Lab</strong></summary>

Under this, we will go through how to setup the directory and lab for the course and how to access various files and execute.

**Lab Setup**

The first step under the lab setup for the course is to form a seperate directory as VLSI and git clone the course files from the given repository in the code.



```bash
$ cd Documents
$ cd ASICs
$ cd VLSI
$ cd git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop.git
```

Terminal Window - 
![sky130_gitclone](https://github.com/Shant1R/Shant_IIITB/assets/59409568/8e74128d-3341-4378-9c40-309260327bef)

Upon the cloning, a new folder with the name *sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop* is made. Under this folder, there will be several folders, such as lib which contains the standard set library for sky130 which will be used for the synthesis, verilog_files which contains all the source files and testbenches for the experiments to be done. The contents of each folder can be seen by going into the directory and entering ls.


**Working with iverilog and gtkwave - MUX**

Under this, we go over how load files on iverilog and visualise using gtkwave. The terminal is opened and the directory is set to the verilog_files, where various source files and their respective testbenches are stored. Under this example we will execute the mux using good_mux.v and check the functionality using gtkwave to visualise the dumpfile generated. Both the source file and testbench are loaded to iverilog. 

```bash
$ cd VLSI
$ cd sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop
$ cd verilog_files/
$ ls
$ iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v
$ ./a.out
$ gtkwave tb_good_mux.vcd
```

Screenshot of the terminal - 
![good_mux_terminal](https://github.com/Shant1R/Shant_IIITB/assets/59409568/06396f49-0e6c-487b-8408-82491557a852)

Waveform on GTKWave - 
![good_mux_gtk](https://github.com/Shant1R/Shant_IIITB/assets/59409568/cc8ec616-ac4d-4bc1-801f-0e680247ad69)

The waveform on gtkwave is used to check the variations in the output with the input.

**Code Explaination - MUX**

To edit the code, one can directly open the files or use gvim. The code to access both the source and testbech is given

```bash
$ gvim tb_good_mux.v -o good_mux.v
```


Editor window - 
![code_good_mux](https://github.com/Shant1R/Shant_IIITB/assets/59409568/cf8ca326-755a-4664-ae0b-8c01b8e94723)

There can be multiple ways to generate a mux. Under the given source code. it checks for the select line, if sel is 1, the output follows the input line 1 else it follows input line 0. Under the testbench, the inputs are set as reg and output as wire. The testbench has no primary inputs like the design source code. It instantiate the source code as uut - unit under test, any name can be used. Under the testbench, the dumpfile is generated for visualisation. The input variables are set and the toggled periodically and sets an end time.

<summary><strong>Introduction to Yosys</strong></summary>

Synthesizer is a tool used to convert RTL to netlist. RTL is a level of abstraction used in digital design to describe how data is transferred and processed between registers in a circuit. It's a key step in converting high-level design concepts into hardware descriptions used for synthesis and implementation in ASIC and FPGA design. Whereas, A netlist is a textual representation of an electronic circuit that describes the connections between components such as gates, flip-flops, and other elements. It's used in various stages of electronic design, including simulation and synthesis, to represent the logical structure and interconnections of the circuit's components.

The synthesizer used under this coursework is Yosys.
